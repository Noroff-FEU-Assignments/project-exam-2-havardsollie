# Caffeine

This is my submission for Project Exam 2 in the Noroff Frontend-development program. This project is a social media platform built with the [Noroff API](https://noroff-api-docs.netlify.app/).

## Description

Caffeine is a real life social media platform, but in this project the frontend is completely new. A new user may register a profile, log in and read the feed of posts, posted by fellow users. The users are students and teachers at Noroff. A user is able to create, edit and delete a post. Personalize their profile page and visit other users profile page. The users may interact with each other in form of following each other and react and comment to each others posts.

### Planning

To ensure workflow over the past seven weeks I have used a kanban board to identify tasks and order them in terms of development. A task moves from different slots depending on the status of the task. It starts in the "Open" slot, then moves to "In progress", and finally "Finished". It it very similar to Issues and Boards in GitLab.

A Gantt chart has been used for the overall time plan of the project. Week 1 for researching and inspiration, week 2,3 for design developemt, week 4,5,6 for coding and week 7 for testing and wrapping.

### Design

The requirements for this project is recognisable across the major real life social media platforms out there. Design inspiration had to be taken from Facebook, Reddit and Twitter. Especially the latter in terms of post design and linking profiles. Color choices is something entirely new to stick out from the other competitors. The real Caffeine is also something completely else, therefore I have not taken much inspiration there.

### Code

Connecting to an API for the first time is always an exciting process. Will it work? Of course it will. Once I got a positive response I started to plot the pages together according to the user stories and technical requirements, trying to seperate it as much as possible. I do not want too much code in a single component.

The styling followed with a lot of adjustments to make it look OK across various screen sizes and ensure universal design.
